# My Project
For this task I created a 3 column promotion for my favorite beauty retailer, Cult Beauty. <br> I have focused on 3 of the edits they are selling at the moment. <br>
I have completed all areas of the task, to the best of my ability, using HTML, CSS, Less, Fontawesome and JavaScript. <br>
My code validates through w3c.
